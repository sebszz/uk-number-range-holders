A simple, standalone web-based tool for looking up UK phone number information, including the provider, geographic location (if applicable), and a link to check for spam/call reports. Built with HTML, CSS (using Google Fonts: Rubik), and vanilla JavaScript. No external dependencies beyond browser APIs and remote JSON data (with local fallback).
